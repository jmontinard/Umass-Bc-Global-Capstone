# Tech Stack

The tech stack for the project will be:

1. Frontend: React.js
2. Backend: Node.js with Express.js
3. Database: MongoDB
4. Additional Libraries: Plaid API for bank account linking and transaction data, Passport.js for user authentication and Google OAuth, bcrypt.js for password hashing, jsonwebtoken for token-based authentication, Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling.

# Focus of the Project

The project will be a full-stack application with an even focus on both the frontend and backend. The frontend will provide a user-friendly interface for users to register, log in, link their bank accounts, and view their budget data. The backend will handle user authentication, interact with the Plaid API, and manage the database.

# Type of Application

This will be a web application.

# Goal of the Project

The goal of the project is to provide a budget tracking solution for users. Users will be able to link their bank accounts and view their transaction data in a user-friendly format, helping them track their spending and manage their budget.

# User Demographic

The user demographic is anyone who wants to track their budget and spending. This could include individuals who want to manage their personal finances, as well as small business owners who want to track their business expenses.

# Data Usage

The application will use transaction data from the user's bank account. This data will be fetched using the Plaid API. The application will also store user data in a MongoDB database, including user credentials and Plaid access tokens.

# Approach to Creating the Project

- Database Schema: The MongoDB database will have a User model with fields for the user's name, email, hashed password, and Plaid access token.

- API Issues: The main issue might be handling errors from the Plaid API. For example, the user might enter incorrect bank credentials, or the Plaid API might be temporarily unavailable. These errors need to be handled gracefully in the application.

- Sensitive Information: The application will handle sensitive information like user credentials and Plaid access tokens. User passwords will be hashed before being stored in the database. Plaid access tokens will be stored securely in the database and used to fetch transaction data from the Plaid API.

- Functionality: The application will include user registration and login (with Google OAuth option), bank account linking via Plaid, and a dashboard where users can view their budget data.

- User Flow: Users will start on the home page where they can register or log in. After logging in, they will be prompted to link their bank account. Once their bank account is linked, they will be taken to the dashboard where they can view their budget data.

- Beyond CRUD Features and Stretch Goals: Beyond basic CRUD operations, the application will include integration with the Plaid API for bank account linking and fetching transaction data, user authentication with Google OAuth, and a dashboard with visualizations of the user's spending data. Stretch goals could include adding more detailed spending reports, budgeting tools, and notifications for when the user exceeds their budget.
